Identify certain users by certain characteristics


Instructions: [Install Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/) then click 'Install this script' [on this page](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/33031-trumpy2017). The user list is compiled of people who have frequently and recently commented on /r/the_donald, and is updated nightly.

It currently does not check usernames loaded by Neverending Reddit or 'show more comments'. 

Please feel free to inspect and modify the code to your own desire.  If you have a contribution or feature to add please let me know.
